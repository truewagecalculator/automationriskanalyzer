    <h1>Will AI Replace My Job?</h1>
    <p class="subhead"><a href="/learn/">← Back to Learn</a></p>
    <p class="subhead">
      This is the question almost everyone eventually asks — quietly or out loud.
      Headlines make it sound binary: safe or replaced.
      The reality is more gradual, more uneven, and more controllable than it appears.
    </p>

    <p class="subhead">
      AI rarely replaces entire jobs at once.
      It replaces *tasks* — and the risk depends on which tasks make up your day.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the question feels so urgent</h2>

    <p class="subhead">
      AI is different from past automation waves because it affects knowledge work —
      writing, analysis, planning, and coordination.
      That makes the impact feel personal, even when the change is incremental.
    </p>

    <h2>The wrong way to think about job replacement</h2>

    <p class="subhead">
      Asking “Will AI replace my job?” assumes jobs disappear overnight.
      In practice, automation works through compression:
      fewer people doing the same work, with higher expectations.
    </p>

    <h2>The right way to think about risk</h2>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>How much of my work is repetitive?</li>
      <li>How much requires judgment?</li>
      <li>Do I own outcomes or just execute tasks?</li>
      <li>Could a tool reasonably do this unsupervised?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why two people with the same title can have different risk</h2>

    <p class="subhead">
      A “Marketing Manager” writing strategy briefs has a very different risk profile
      than one scheduling posts and pulling reports.
      Titles don’t matter — task mix does.
    </p>

    <h2>The most common automation pattern</h2>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Assist → AI helps you do work faster</li>
      <li>Automate → AI does routine work alone</li>
      <li>Redesign → your role shifts upward</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What actually protects your job</h2>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Judgment under uncertainty</li>
      <li>Responsibility for outcomes</li>
      <li>Exception handling</li>
      <li>Human trust and communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Turning anxiety into clarity</h2>

    <p class="subhead">
      Fear comes from vagueness.
      Clarity comes from specificity.
      That’s why we built the Automation Risk Analyzer.
    </p>

    <p class="subhead">
      <a href="/">Run your job through the analyzer</a> to see:
    </p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Your automation risk score</li>
      <li>The tasks most likely to change</li>
      <li>Skills that reduce risk</li>
      <li>A realistic timeline</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subhead">
      AI doesn’t replace people — it replaces uncertainty with pressure.
      Knowing where you stand is the first step to staying ahead.
    </p>
