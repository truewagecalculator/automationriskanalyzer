      <h1>About Automation Risk Analyzer</h1>
      <p class="subhead">
        Automation Risk Analyzer helps you understand how automation and AI may change a job over time.
        Enter a job title to see an estimated risk score, tasks most likely to be automated, skills that reduce risk,
        and an approximate disruption timeline.
      </p>

      <h3>What this tool is (and isn’t)</h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>It is</strong> a planning tool designed to help you think clearly about how work is evolving.</li>
        <li><strong>It is not</strong> a prediction of layoffs, hiring decisions, or your personal career outcome.</li>
        <li>Real-world risk varies by seniority, industry, company, region, and how your role is actually performed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How the score works</h3>
      <p class="subhead" style="margin-bottom:10px;">
        Our estimates are derived from common task patterns across role families. Roles that are more repetitive, rules-driven,
        and structured tend to be easier to automate. Roles requiring higher judgment, accountability, and human interaction
        tend to change more slowly.
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Automation Risk Score (0–100%)</strong> is an estimate of how much of the role’s task mix could be automated over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Tasks likely to be automated</strong> highlights areas where tools often replace manual work first.</li>
        <li><strong>Skills that reduce risk</strong> focuses on capabilities that remain valuable even as tools improve.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeline estimate</strong> is a directional window for disruption phases (assist → partial automation → redesign).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why we built this</h3>
      <p class="subhead">
        Most content about “AI replacing jobs” is generic, fear-driven, and non-interactive. This tool is designed to be practical:
        it turns anxiety into an action plan by showing which skills and responsibilities remain resilient.
      </p>
